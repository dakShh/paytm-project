# PAYTM - A banking application
This is a modern banking application that enables users to send and receive money, check balances, and view transaction history, similar to a real bank. The application is built using Next.js for the frontend, Prisma as an ORM, PostgreSQL for the database, and styled with Tailwind CSS and `@chadcn/ui` components.

## Tech Stack
